This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in TypeScript related to optional parameters and how they interact with undefined values.  The initial implementation of `printName` attempts to use a type guard to determine if a name is provided. However, this logic fails to handle the case where an undefined value is passed as an argument.  The solution demonstrates the correct approach, leveraging TypeScript's type system to handle undefined values gracefully.
